This is just the production version of the Peachy Printer PCB, converted from Eagle format to Kicad.

Thanks to:
Rylan Grayston and the Peachy Team (for opening-sourceing, not just the 
					software, but the entire peachy design)
lachlanA (for the eagle to kicad conversion ULP)
Erich Heine (for the eagle half of the conversion)
